# CSS566_Winter2020
This repository holds the Winter 2020 CSS 566 class Product. For our product we are creating a Gacha Game. 
A Gacha game is a game the involves a player collecting characters that they pulled from loot boxes or another similar mechanism. The game then usually involves something you can do with the characters like missions or an adventure story that produce rewards (usually the currency that you use to pull for more characters).
